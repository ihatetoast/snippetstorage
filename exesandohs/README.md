# Exes and Ohs
Check to see if a string has the same amount of 'x's and 'o's. The method must return a boolean and be case insensitive. The string can contains any char.

Examples input/output:

XO("ooxx") => true
XO("xooxx") => false
XO("ooxXm") => true
XO("zpzpzpp") => true // when no 'x' and 'o' is present should return true
XO("zzoo") => false


---
# test:
Test.assertEquals(XO('xo'),true);
Test.assertEquals(XO("xxOo"),true);
Test.assertEquals(XO("xxxm"),false);
Test.assertEquals(XO("Oo"),false);
Test.assertEquals(XO("ooom"),false);

# my notes
Regex is the way to go. I like my second go more than the best but that's probably because I love math.
